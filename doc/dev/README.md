A quick start guide to get Kepler up and running.

## Pre-requisites

This guide assumes you have the following installed:

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) or [Podman](https://podman.io/getting-started/installation)
- [Go](https://golang.org/doc/install)
- [Kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/docs/user/quick-start/)

In order to make contributions to Kepler, you need to have the following installed:

- [Pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/#install)

You can install pre-commit by running the following command:

```bash
pip install pre-commit
```

After installing pre-commit, you need to install the pre-commit hooks by running the following command:

```bash
pre-commit install
```

## Create a new ephemeral local kubernetes cluster

Use `make cluster-up` to setup a local development cluster running in Kind.

The make target `cluster-up` works by cloning [local-dev-cluster repo](https://github.com/sustainable-computing-io/local-dev-cluster)
locally and using the scripts in the repo to setup a Kubernetes running locally
using `Kind`.

**NOTE**: Considering that your local environment is different to CI, we strongly
recommend that you check [prerequisites](https://github.com/sustainable-computing-io/local-dev-cluster#prerequisites)
and [start up](https://github.com/sustainable-computing-io/local-dev-cluster#startup) to
customize your own local development environment.

You can find technical discussions within the community regarding this topic by
following [this enhancements proposal](../../enhancements/CICDv1.md) and
[related issue](https://github.com/sustainable-computing-io/kepler/issues/721).

## Build and run Kepler on your cluster

```bash
make cluster-deploy
```

Make target `cluster-deploy` does the following

- Build the necessary manifests.
- Build and Push the Kepler image to local registry.
- Deploys Kepler with the newly created image.
- Validate Kepler installation.

If you want to use container registry of your choice:

```bash
make cluster-deploy IMAGE_REPO=index.docker.io/myrepo IMAGE_TAG=mybuild NO_BUILD=true
```

If you want to run Kepler with privileged setup:

```bash
make cluster-deploy IMAGE_REPO=index.docker.io/myrepo IMAGE_TAG=mybuild OPTS=ROOTLESS NO_BUILD=true
```

## To run Kepler externally to the cluster

This quick tutorial is for developing and testing Kepler locally but with access to kubelet

### Install bcc-devel and kernel-devel

Refer to the [builder Dockerfile](https://github.com/sustainable-computing-io/kepler/blob/main/build/Dockerfile.builder)

### Compile

Go to the root of the repo and do the following:

```bash
 make _build_local
```

If successful, the binary is at `_output/bin/_/kepler`

### Test

Create the k8s role and token, copy data files, this is only needed once.

```bash
cd dev/
./create_k8s_token.sh
./prepare_dev_env.sh
```

Then run the Kepler binary at `_output/bin/_/kepler`

Kepler metrics are available under <host_ip>:8888/metrics by default

## Build kepler and base multi-arch images

```bash
./hack/build-images.sh help
```
### Profiling Kepler

`kepler` exposes [standard go profiling](https://pkg.go.dev/net/http/pprof)
endpoint at `/debug/pprof/profile`. Following examples show how to
profile kepler with `go tool pprof`.

**NOTE:** These examples assume `kepler` is running (or
port-forwarded in case of k8s) on `localhost:8888`.

Detailed  information about using pprof can be found in their
[documentation](https://github.com/google/pprof/tree/main/doc).

#### CPU Profiling

```bash
go tool pprof 'http://localhost:8888/debug/pprof/profile?seconds=30'
```

#### Memory (heap) Profiling

```bash
go tool pprof 'http://localhost:8888/debug/pprof/heap?seconds=30'
```

#### Visualizing pprof

`-http` option can be used to visualize existing pprof in

```bash
go tool pprof -http 0.0.0.0:8000 \
	'http://localhost:8888/debug/pprof/heap?seconds=30'

```
or

```bash
go tool pprof -http 0.0.0.0:8000 <path/to/pprof-capture>.pb.gz

```
