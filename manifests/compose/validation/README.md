# Setup

In order to validate models, here is the recommended setup assuming the
development box is a Baremetal.

1. Create a Virtual Machine

1. Ensure the CPU is pinned to the VM. E.g. if you are using libvirt, you can
   use `vcpupin` as follows

   ```text
   virsh vcpupin <vm_name> <cpu_number> <core-number>
   ```

## Baremetal

The `metal` compose target should be run on a metal / development machine. This
target deploys the following

- kepler - built from source with process metrics enabled
- scaphandre: as a target to compare kepler metrics against
- prometheus: that scrapes - metal kepler, scaphandre, and a host identified as
  `vm`
- grafana with a dashboard for comparing metal process metrics (qemu) against vm

### Usage

```sh
cd manifests/compose/validation/metal
export VM_IP=192.168....
docker compose up
```

## Virtual Machine

1. `vm` compose target should be run on a Virtual Machine. This target deploys
   `kepler` with `estimator` and `model-server` version: 0.7.7 Usage:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/sustainable-computing-io/kepler
cd manifests/compose/validation/metal
docker compose up
```

Ensure the setup works by `curl http://<vm-ip>:9100/metrics` from the Baremetal
machine.
