# Kepler enhancements

This folder is meant to hold design discussions for Kepler feature requests and
issues. Ideally, design discussions should follow issues from the
[Kepler Project Board](https://github.com/orgs/sustainable-computing-io/projects).
For example, view the
[kepler-release-0.4-planning](https://github.com/orgs/sustainable-computing-io/projects/2).

To create a design discussion for a current issue:

- Use the [enhancement template](./TEMPLATE.md) to create a design document.
- Open a PR to invite discussions via GH comments.
- Include in the `enhancement PR description` a link to an open issue, if
  applicable.
- After the enhancement design is agreed upon, the enhancement PR will be
  merged.
- Include a link to the enhancement PR in any future PRs to implement the
  feature.

> _Note_: Update this README.md and/or the TEMPLATE.md with useful information
> to make the future enhancement process more efficient and effective!
