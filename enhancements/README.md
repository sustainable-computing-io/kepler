## Kepler enhancements 

This folder is meant to hold design discussions for Kepler feature requests and issues.
Ideally, design discussions should follow issues from the [Kepler Project Board](https://github.com/orgs/sustainable-computing-io/projects).
For example, view the [kepler-release-0.4-planning](https://github.com/orgs/sustainable-computing-io/projects/2). 

To create a design discussion for a current issue:

* Use the [enhancement template](./TEMPLATE.md) to create a design document.
* Open a PR to invite discussions via GH comments.
* Include in the `enhancement PR description` a link to an open issue, if applicable.
* After the enhancement design is agreed upon, the enhancement PR will be merged.
* Include a link to the enhancement PR in any future PRs to implement the feature.

> Update this README.md and/or the TEMPLATE.md with useful information to make the future enhancement process more efficient and effective!
